CODSOFT Data Analysis and Machine Learning Internship Repository Welcome to my internship repository! This repository documents the data analysis and machine learning projects I undertook during my internship at Codsoft. Each project aimed to enhance my skills and practical knowledge in handling real-world datasets, building predictive models, and extracting valuable insights from data.

Repository Contents This repository contains the following projects:

Titanic Survival Prediction: In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict the survival likelihood of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features. The goal was to understand the factors that contributed to survival outcomes.

Movie Rating Prediction with Python: I built a predictive model to estimate movie ratings here. By analyzing features like genre, director, cast, and user reviews, I aimed to forecast how well a movie might be received by audiences.



Sales Prediction Using Python: In this project, I developed a sales prediction model for a retail company using historical sales data and external factors such as holidays and promotions. The objective was to assist the company in anticipating sales trends and making informed business decisions.
